 * Flask
 * Flask-API
 * Among others as listed in `requirements.txt`
 
2. ######Installing virtualenvwrapper
 A Virtual Environment is a tool to keep the dependencies required by different projects in separate places, by creating virtual Python environments for them.
 To install virtualenvwrapper follow the link [installing virtualenvwrapper](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/).
3. ######Cloning the repo

 To clone the repo type the following command in terminal:

 $ git clone https://github.com/andela-engmkwalusimbi/checkpoints/tree/develop/checkpoint2/BucketListApi
 ```
 
 To install all app requirements type these command in your terminal one after the other:

 $ pip install -r requirements.txt
 ```
 
4. ######Setting up enviroment variables
 To set up enviroment variables follow the [Setting env variables](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-read-and-set-environmental-and-shell-variables-on-a-linux-vps), so as they can be used with your app.
 Ensure your create `APP_SETTINGS` and `DATABASE_URL` in your env variables.

5. ######Managing Database set up

To get started install Postgres on your local computer if you donâ€™t have it already. if you haven't follow this [Setting up postgresql](http://www.postgresql.org/download/) and choose your appropriate OS.
Run the following commands on the terminal to set up tables and manage upgrades to tables if you change your models.

 * In order to run our migrations initialize Alembic, this command will create a migrations `directory`:

 ```
 $ python manage.py db init
 ```

 * To create your first migration running the `migrate` command:

 ```
 $ python manage.py db migrate
 ```

 * To apply upgrades to your database use the db `upgrade` command:

 ```
 $ python manage.py db upgrade
 ```

 Your database is now ready to use with the app.

###Running the API

To run the `API` type the following command in your terminal:

```
$ python routes.py
```
